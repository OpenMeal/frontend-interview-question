# OpenMeal Frontend Coding Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)!

## Information

This will be 1-hour Pair Programming with empty React code. You will be tested on front-end fundamentals, component design, and git.

You will be given a link to Google Hangouts and will be sharing your screen.

1. You will be tasked to build a component from scratch!

2. If you get to the end, we'll finish it off by committing your work and pushing the commit to this repository.

3. Finally, you will make a PR to merge your new branch to the main branch.

You will have the opportunity to ask questions to our engineers at the end. So come prepared!
